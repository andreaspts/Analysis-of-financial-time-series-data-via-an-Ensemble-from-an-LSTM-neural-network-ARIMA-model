# Analysis of financial time series data via an Ensemble built from an LSTM neural network and an ARIMA model

A **time-series** is an ordered sequence of observations the temporal dependence of which reveals trend, seasonality and shock propagation. The goal of time series analysis is to investigate the path of observations of time series and to build models to describe the structure of data and then to predict the future values of the series. When the observations are asset prices, returns or liquidity metrics it becomes a **financial time series**, forming the empirical base of valuation, risk control, and policy surveillance.

**Linear models** such as **ARIMA** offer statistical transparency but assume stationarity and short-range memory, constraints routinely violated by markets that exhibit regime shifts, volatility clustering and non-linear feedback. **Deep-learning approaches**, especially **recurrent neural networks (RNNs)**, discard these assumptions by learning high-order, non-linear mappings directly from data.

The **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** architecture augments RNNs with gated cells that preserve information over hundreds of lags, enabling it to capture dynamics that ARIMA cannot without manual lag inflation or hybrid extensions (like an ARIMA-GARCH stack). (Note that GARCH stands for generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity model.) Empirical studies show well-regularised LSTMs deliver lower forecast error and more coherent risk estimates than such hybrid models, particularly when heterogeneous signals (i.e. information beyond the raw price series like order flow, macro news, technical factors etc.) are fed into the network. Nonetheless, their performance hinges on ample data, robust cross-validation and strict out-of-sample testing.

Despite their limitations, **ARIMA models** remain foundational in time series forecasting due to their interpretability, fast estimation and suitability for short-memory processes. They provide a reliable benchmark and often outperform more complex models on small or well-behaved datasets, especially when domain-specific tuning (e.g. differencing, AIC selection etc.) is applied.

Combining models through an **ensemble approach** leverages the complementary strengths of each: ARIMA captures linear, short-run dependencies while LSTM models non-linear, longer-run interactions. Empirical evidence suggests that ensemble forecasts often improve robustness, reduce overfitting, and yield lower error metrics than either model alone, particularly when model disagreement signals structural shifts or uncertainty.

The goal of this projekt is to reproduce results on the ensemble approach presented in the publication Mochurad L., Dereviannyi A., “An ensemble approach integrating LSTM and ARIMA models for enhanced financial market predictions”, 2024, Royal Society Open Science 11: 240699, https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.240699 and to critically discuss their work.
